# Hi there! 👩🏻‍🦰✌🏻

Seems like you've stumbled upon an awesome gem on the webz! 💎 
Let me introduce myself:

- Web Developer and UI Designer since 2007
- experienced IT Project Manager and leader of software development teams for half a decade (mostly e-Commerce projects, B2C and B2C)
- reboot as **Fullstack Software Developer** missing hands-on-development
- working as a Software Developer in the public healthcare sector for almost two years by now

This journey totally reflects my passion for technology, exploration and agile development. 🙌✨

As natural born solution seeker, I've got an itchy motivation for mastering challenges and improving things as well as pushing my own personal evolution forward. My approach: curiosity, an analytical perspective as well as a tackle mentality, but also compassion, realistic optimism and contagious enthusiasm. 
I love to hone my skills and knowledge on a daily basis. The topics that peak my interests at the moment are accessibility, designsystems, testing and testing related concepts, DevOps and all the exciting everchanging technologies and frameworks. 

I am always excited about the awesome results when collaborating with open minded people who are driven by intrinsic motivation. Therefore I like an open error / opinion culture, which allows everyone to thrive and grow.

If you'd like to team up with me on a project or simply like to connect, feel free to send me a DM/invite on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annekeschuette-hh/).
Since I am working on non-public projects, notice that this account is now mainly used as a playground.

Fun facts: 
- Action movie narcoleptic 💥😴
- I know all 151(+1) first-gen Pokémon 🤓
- to relax I breed dinosaurs 🎮🥚🦖 
- Professional seagull imitator 🌊📢🐦


_AD: In order to refurbish my coding skills I attended a three-month Coding Bootcamp of [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/) in 2021 (MERN stack - take a look at my capstone project, if you like! 🚀😊)._
